## Ovewrview

I'm eager to become a Frontend developer with strong skills.
I always look for opportunities to learn new technologies or master the ones I am familiar with.

I know how to use google and find information on programming issues.

My previous field is Industrial safety and civil defence where I have been working in team on different projects for more than 5 years, so I can say that I am a team player.

## Code example

Here is my solution for codewars task to write a function which calculates a digital root of number (for example, digital root of 856 is 1:

8 + 5 + 6 = 19   =>   1 + 9 = 10   =>   1 + 0 = 1
```
function digitalRoot(n) {
  let sum = 0
  let lastDigit = n % 10
  sum = sum + lastDigit
  let rest = (n - lastDigit) / 10
  if (rest + sum < 10) {
    return sum + rest
  } else {
    return digitalRoot(rest + sum)
  }
}
```

## Experience

For now I have only learning experience of developing:
- couple of landing pages, 
- some interesting features on JavaScript (including a little [aiming game](https://github.com/malinka775/js_features/tree/master/05-aim-game-sources) and [painting board](https://github.com/malinka775/js_features/tree/master/04-board-sources))
- a [social network pet-project](https://gitlab.com/malinka7751/khasanova_alina_pcs_frontend_21_09_homeworks/-/tree/my_final_project) on React, JavaScript
- a minor [SPA](https://github.com/malinka775/kts-front-winter-2022) on TypeScript where I used REST API queries
