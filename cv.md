## Ovewrview

I'm eager to become a Frontend developer with strong skills.
I always look for opportunities to learn new technologies or master the ones I am familiar with.

I know how to use google and find information on programming issues.

My previous field is Industrial safety and civil defence where I have been working in team on different projects for more than 5 years, so I can say that I am a team player.

## Code example

Here is my solution for codewars task to write a function which calculates a digital root of number (for example, digital root of 856 is 1:

8 + 5 + 6 = 19   =>   1 + 9 = 10   =>   1 + 0 = 1
```
function digitalRoot(n) {
  let sum = 0
  let lastDigit = n % 10
  sum = sum + lastDigit
  let rest = (n - lastDigit) / 10
  if (rest + sum < 10) {
    return sum + rest
  } else {
    return digitalRoot(rest + sum)
  }
}
```
